We now have to think of all the different platforms your site might be viewed from. Once apon a time it was simply the humble desktop, now days your audience will more than likely be finding you from a phone or tablet device. So what does this mean? Take your current website for example, if it's been around for a few years, its likely to be a fixed width site that gets shrunk down when viewed on a mobile device. This means a lot of frustrating zoom in / zoom out behaviour for your viewers - far from ideal!<br class="visible-lg"></p> <h4 class="grey">What are the mobile web user statistics?</h4><img src="images/stars.png"> <p><a class="btn btn-sm btn-grey" href="#/mobile">READ MORE</a></p><a href="http://www.imaging4dev.com" target="_blank"><img alt="responsive website design" class="img-responsive center-block" ng-src="images/web/Responsive_02.png" spinner-on-load=""></a> </div><!-- ENDS col --> </div><!-- ENDS row --> </div><!-- ENDS conatiner --> </div><!-- ENDS band-grey --> <div class="band-greyDark"> <div class="container wow bounceInUp"> <div class="row div-full"> <div class="col-sm-12 text-center"> <h2>Our design process</h2><br> </div> <div class="col-sm-3 text-center"> <img ng-src="images/icon_plan.png" class="img-icon img-responsive center-block wow bounceInUp" alt="planning" spinner-on-load> <h4>Planning</h4> <p> This is the most critical phase of any website build. Here we lay the foundations of how your website will look, function and communicate. Time spent in this early planning stage mapping out key objectives, determining your target market and developing strategies for users to contact you will significantly impact the success of your website. </p> <hr class="visible-xs dashed-pad40"> </div><!-- ENDS col --> <div class="col-sm-3 text-center"> <img ng-src="images/icon_graphics.png" class="img-icon img-responsive center-block wow bounceInUp" alt="design" spinner-on-load data-wow-delay="0.2s"> <h4>Designing</h4> <p> Here we develop the visual concepts of how your wesbite will look, including full mock ups of all the key template pages within your website. We focus on the layout of the key components (established in the planning stage), their positioning, styling, colour pallets, use of photography, typography and other design elements and features. </p> <hr class="visible-xs dashed-pad40"> </div><!-- ENDS col --> <div class="col-sm-3 text-center"> <img ng-src="images/icon_code.png" class="img-icon img-responsive center-block wow bounceInUp" alt="coding" spinner-on-load data-wow-delay="0.4s"> <h4>Coding</h4> <p> Upon reaching agreement on the design of your new website, we then convert your mock ups into HTML and CSS code allowing them to function within a web browser. Additional functionality such as special affects, forms, dynamic data derived from a database or a fully integrated CMS (content management system) are also implemented here. </p> <hr class="visible-xs dashed-pad40"> </div><!-- ENDS col --> <div class="col-sm-3 text-center"> <img ng-src="images/icon_bus_websites.png" class="img-icon img-responsive center-block wow bounceInUp" alt="going live" spinner-on-load data-wow-delay="0.6s"> <h4>Going Live!</h4> <p> Finally we test all functions and components of your site including forms, dynamic data delivery, content management, cross browser compatibilty, the responsiveness and appearance of your site on different devices such as smart phones and tablets. Once this has been completed we configure the hosting environment and launch your site live! </p> </div><!-- ENDS col --> </div><!-- ENDS row --> </div><!-- ENDS conatiner --> </div><!-- ENDS band-grey --> <div class="band-grey" id="gallery"> <div class="container"> <!-- INCLUDE athletics --> <div ng-include="'views/websites/athletics.html'"></div> </div><!-- ENDS container --> </div><!-- ENDS band --> <div class="band" id="gallery"> <div class="container"> <!-- INCLUDE lovegrove --> <div ng-include="'views/websites/lovegrove.html'"></div> </div><!-- ENDS container --> </div><!-- ENDS band --> <div class="band-grey" id="gallery"> <div class="container"> <!-- INCLUDE elearn --> <div ng-include="'views/websites/elearn.html'"></div> </div><!-- ENDS container --> </div><!-- ENDS band --> <div class="band" id="gallery"> <div class="container"> <!-- INCLUDE lacigale --> <div ng-include="'views/websites/lacigale.html'"></div> </div><!-- ENDS container --> </div><!-- ENDS band --> <div class="band-grey" id="gallery"> <div class="container"> <div class="row no-gutters"> <div class="col-md-12 text-center"> <h2 class="grey">– Other Work –</h2> </div> </div><!-- ENDS row no-gutters --> <div class="row no-gutters"> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure class="cap-bot"> <img alt="Track &amp; Field Statistics" class="img-responsive" ng-src="images/web/web_browser2.png" spinner-on-load=""> <a href="#/websites" target="_blank" scroll-to="#north" scroll-to-item=""> <figcaption> <h3>Track &amp; Field Statistics</h3> <p>Statistical performance analysis tool<br> CSS3, AnjularJS, PHP (Laravel), MySql</p> </figcaption></a> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <figure class="cap-bot"> <img alt="The Events Group" class="img-responsive" ng-src="images/web/web_browser8.png" spinner-on-load=""> <a href="#/websites" scroll-to="#north" scroll-to-item=""> <figcaption> <h3>The Events Group</h3> <p>Business website<br> Wordpress, custom theme</p> </figcaption></a> </figure> </div> </div><!-- ENDS row no-gutters --> </div><!--ENDS container--> </div><!-- ENDS band --> </div><!-- ENDS main-container --> <div style="margin-bottom:100px"></div> <div ng-include="'views/banners/footer.html'"></div>
